Thia app adds WebHook support to RapidSMS. 

RapidSMS is a Django based open source SMS framework: http://rapidsms.org

A WebHook is simply a URL that an application sends a POST request to whenever a certain event occurs (eg, GitHub WebHooks: http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/ )

In this implementation, whenever RapidSMS receives an SMS message, it sends a POST request with the message content and phone ID to URLs defined in webhook/config.py. If the response body contains any text, it is SMSed back to the sending phone.

INSTALL

1. Add the webhook/ directory under the RapidSMS apps/ dir
2. Add 'webhook' to local.ini 
3. Set target_urls in webhook/config.py to the POST target, as explained below.


CONFIGURE

The target URLs are defined in a dictionary object in config.py. Each dictionary item contains a keyword and a matching URL. (The keyword is the first word in the SMS message). '*' is a default URL, to be used if no matching keyword was found.

For example, this setting will match the keywords 'test' and 'another' to specific URLs:

target_urls = {
    'test'  : 'http://sometest.com/',
    'another' : 'http://anothertest.com/',
}

While this setting uses only '*', so any message will be sent to the specified target URL:

target_urls = {
    '*'  : 'http://qkhack.appspot.com/rapid',
}

TEST

You can use the target URL http://qkhack.appspot.com/rapid to test this app. This URL will return the message "hey '<phone>', you said '<message>'".
